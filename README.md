# Trajectory-Modeling-and-Prediction-with-Destination-Information
For tracking and predicting the behavior of moving objects a mathematical model is presented to model trajectories with destination information, where uncertainties are taken into account. The presented model is based on a class of stochastic processes called conditionally Markov (CM) processes.
Also, LSTM is used for collision prediction.
